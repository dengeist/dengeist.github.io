summary: Your face is different every time I tell this story.
---

Your face looks different every time I tell this story.

You know the one: we’re in your studio; we’re on your bed; you have a guitar. You’re singing. If I turn my head toward you at all, I can smell your cologne, so I don’t. You do these things like they’re okay, and I’m the one who lets you. I keep thinking about your hands. You make the transition from one chord to the next look so easy, and I’d take your version of Let It Be over Paul McCartney’s any day. You have your knees folded up under yourself. Your leg is touching my leg. My hand is on my thigh. Just a few centimeters to the left and I could touch you. I could. But I don’t. Anyway: your face.

I know what color your eyes are. I know that you smile with one half of your mouth; I know there are parentheses on either side. It’s a good joke – like anything here is optional. I know you had a bit of a beard in this story. I think about all of these things individually. I think about them all of the time, I promise I do, but I can’t put them together.

Did you know there are people who can’t picture faces at all?

I saw a man on YouTube talk about how he can only say what his coffee table looks like because he knows all the words that make up a coffee table – brown and oak and polished – but there’s no table in his head. It’s called “aphantasia”. An absence of fantasy. Imagine that: not being able to imagine.

I have a different problem, I guess. I can see just enough of your face to miss the rest. I can get all of those pieces together, but I couldn’t tell you where they go. 

You don’t have to tell me, because I know: I know I am making myself the victim in this story. Boys like you don’t like boys like me. They don’t like boys at all. I signed that contract. I spent time with you anyway. I was never brave enough to ask you why, if we agreed to these rules, I was on your bed at midnight, letting you point your voice right at my heart.

You remember what happens next: you take me home; you thank me for hanging out; I thank you for playing for me. I know you smile at me, and I know it reaches your eyes, but I can’t think of these things at the same time. You see my problem?

Anyway, I have a better idea. You wanna hear?

Let’s say you’re telling me to let it be and let’s say I don’t. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that I break our contract. I put my hand on your leg and I can feel your muscles under my palm. You put your hand on my hand and it is all the right words: warm and soft, but with gentle callouses from how much you play. 

You can imagine the rest for yourself. You can imagine that all I want is a version of this story where I tell you I've never been very good at contracts. A version of this story where I learn to say it out loud. A version of the story where you kiss me, perhaps. You feel my beard; you laugh and pull away. 

It’s different, you say. You say that every time. But I like it. 

I want a version of this story that ends any other way than how it does: you, dead; me, making up a version of myself that can finally get it right.

You can imagine that my problem is imagining too much.
